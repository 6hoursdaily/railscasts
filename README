= Railscasts

This is a rewrite of the Railscasts site (http://railscasts.com).

Please let me know if you plan to use this app for your site.


== Setup

1. install rails 2.1 if you haven't already
2. run 'rake gems:install' in project directory
3. make config/database.yml (see example_database.yml)
4. migrate the databases (rake db:migrate)
5. make config/app_config.yml (see example_app_config.yml)
6. script/server and enjoy!

If you want to run the tests, you'll need to install the latest rspec 
plugins. Instructions: http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails/wikis

You will also need to install the gems.

  rake gems:install RAILS_ENV='test'
