= Railscasts

This is a rewrite of the Railscasts site (http://railscasts.com).

Please let me know if you plan to use this app for your site.


== Setup

1. install rails 2.1 if you haven't already
2. make config/database.yml (see example_database.yml)
3. migrate the databases (rake db:migrate)
4. make config/app_config.yml (see example_app_config.yml)
5. run 'rake gems:install'
6. script/server and enjoy!

If you want to run the tests, you'll need to install the latest rspec plugins.

  script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec
  script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails

You will also need to install the gems.

  rake gems:install RAILS_ENV='test'

I may add plugins to the repository later, just not yet.
