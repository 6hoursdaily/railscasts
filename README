This is a rewrite of the Railscasts site (http://railscasts.com).

Please read the license if you plan to use this code.


== Setup

1. install edge rails (until 2.1 is released)
2. make config/database.yml (see example_database.yml)
3. migrate the databases (rake db:migrate)
4. script/server and enjoy!

If you want to run the tests, you'll need to install the latest rspec plugins.

  script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec
  script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails

You will also need to install the mocha gem.

  gem install mocha

I may add plugins to the repository later, just not yet.
